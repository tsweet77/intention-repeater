10/16/2020 v1.0 Intention Repeater Chat created.
10/17/2020 v1.1 Added a percent counter for progress.
10/17/2020 v1.2 Added display of runtime.

New C++ Versions:
10/21/2020 v1.0 Converted to C++. It runs fast enough now that there is no need to display execution time.
10/23/2020 v1.1 Allowed randomizer function to run repeatedly, instead of just once. This allows the spiritual being that is contacted to better control it.
10/24/2020 v1.2 Updated to use PROCESS_STATEMENT as provided by Frank_Is_Not_My_Name from the Intention Repeater forum.
10/24/2020 v2.0 Updated to use a Vector instead of an Array, to allow for faster sorting. Now, THINK_DEPTH = 100000. Put defined variables at the top.
10/25/2020 v2.2 Fixed bugs with how it clears the array each run. Undid the Vector because it was causing problems. Allows THINK_DEPTH = 30,000 or more. Added important values in easy to read manner toward the beginning.
